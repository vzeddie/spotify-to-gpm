I wanted to switch from Spotify to Google Play Music (GPM). Spotify was like $10/month and so was GPM but GPM also came with YouTube Red. I haven't watched a YouTube ad in at least a year and it has been great (soon to be gone though for YouTube Music... I don't know how I feel about that). There were a couple playlists in Spotify I wanted to keep though, and make its equivalent in GPM assuming GPM had the songs. So this script will require you download the entirety of a Spotify playlist's
HTML. Go to the Spotify website, open up the playlist, and scroll down until you have all your songs scrollable. Download the source of that page. Then use this script (populate the `.conf` file) to let it read the songs and connect to GPM, search for the song, and put it in a new playlist!
